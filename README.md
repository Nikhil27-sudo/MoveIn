# MoveIn App

Moving into a shared living space can pose challenges, as it often involves adapting to new living arrangements, social dynamics, and different lifestyles. To ease this transition, we propose "MoveIn," a specially designed app that offers roommates a fun and social way to connect through shared interests and backgrounds, distribute household chores, view each other's calendars, and plan events together through a chat or interactive interface.

## Project Overview

MoveIn was developed following a user-centered design approach, consisting of three key phases: Conceptualization, Design, and Evaluation.

### Conceptualization

The project started with a thorough exploration of user needs, involving a PACT analysis, interviews, and the creation of personas and task descriptions. This phase helped in defining the goals and objectives of the MoveIn app.

### Design

Moving into the design phase, we focused on creating an accessible and user-friendly interface. Low-fidelity prototypes like storyboards and paper prototypes were initially crafted, followed by high-fidelity mockups to balance functionality and user-friendliness. Iterative design processes emphasized the significance of feedback in refining the system.

### Evaluation

The project involved a comparative analysis of two main menu designs for the MoveIn app(Involved A/B testing of two main menu designs). Statistical tests revealed significant time differences in user task completion, while user satisfaction remained high for both designs. Key lessons included the nuanced nature of design preferences, the importance of user feedback, and the need to consider accessibility factors.

## Reflection

Attention to detail and a balance between creativity and functionality emerged as crucial aspects. Small design elements significantly impacted the user experience. Striking a balance between visual appeal and functionality was key to ensuring MoveIn provided a positive and functional user experience.
